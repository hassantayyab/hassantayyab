### Hey there 👋

#### I'm Hassan 😉, an enthusiastic web developer and designer dedicated to crafting visually stunning and high-performance websites 💻, ensuring an exceptional user experience 🎈.

Since childhood, my passion for visual art and creating aesthetically pleasing designs with colors 🖍️ and paper 📄 has been evident. As I delved deeper into computer science, earning a bachelor's degree in the field, I seamlessly melded my love for design and art with technical expertise. This synthesis empowered me to develop user-friendly software, paving the way for my fulfilling career as a web designer 👨‍🎨 and developer 👷‍♂️.
